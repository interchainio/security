### Bug Bounty

As part of our coordinated vulnerability dislcosure policy, we offer a Safe Harbor to all security researchers who work with us in good faith.  Please visit our Bug Bounty program at [https://hackerone.com/cosmos](https://hackerone.com/cosmos) to learn more, and to report any Security issues you may discover in the Interchain Stack.

Additionally, the @security alias at [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io) is continuously monitored for security coordination.
