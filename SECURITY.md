# Security Policy

As part of our coordinated vulnerability dislcosure policy, we offer a Safe Harbor to all security researchers who work with us in good faith. 
Please visit our Bug Bounty program at [https://hackerone.com/cosmos](https://hackerone.com/cosmos) to learn more, and to report any Security issues you may discover in the Interchain Stack.

Additionally, the @security alias at security@interchain.io is continuously monitored for security coordination. 
If you are unable to utilize the HackerOne program link above, non-bounty submissions may be sent to [security@interchain.io](mailto:security@interchain.io)
